## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Belen Martinez and I'm an aspiring data scientist with experience on 10+ technical projects. My skills include Python, SQL, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. Now, I'm eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills in the media, public service, and research & development spheres to drive growth and creativity.

My previous experience in miscellaneous jobs helped to develop my communication, analytical, time-management, and problem-solving skills. This proved useful upon enrolling in the TripleTen Data Science program. The curriculum included Python, EDA, Statistical Data Analysis, SQL, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects and collaboration.

Since completing the above stated program, I am currently growing my knowledge base by working with real-world data. I am also preparing for an externship program offered through TripleTen, which will no doubt only increase my insight and skill level. You can learn more about me through my other repositories or through other contact information listed below. Thank you and feel free to reach out and connect at any time!
