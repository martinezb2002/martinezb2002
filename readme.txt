With very little support, I had to find a way to not only make it through the day but also grow and progress. I was on the hunt for a key to my future. After moving around a lot and doing my time at miscellaneous jobs, I was introduced to TripleTen - and the tech industry as a whole. TripleTen allowed me an opportunity to learn the basics of coding while geared on a path to become a data scientist. During my time here, I was fully immersed into the worlds of Python, SQL, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. Over the course of 10+ intense projects, I tackled real-world business cases, utilizing data to drive improvements and achieve tangible results.
Now equipped with proficient skills in big data analysis and visualization, I am eager to apply my expertise within the media, public service, and research & development industries. I'm dedicated to contributing to an ethically driven company by driving growth and creatively making use of my skills and thought processes that were gained outside of the tech field. </p>
